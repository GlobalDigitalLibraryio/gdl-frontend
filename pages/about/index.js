          The Global Digital Library (GDL) is being developed to increase the

              The GDL will collect existing high quality open educational
              reading resources, and make them available on web, mobile and for
              print. It will also facilitate translation and localization of
              these resources to more than 300 languages. The goal is to make at
              least 50.000 titles in 100 languages available on the GDL-platform
              by the end of 2020.
            </P>
            <P>
              The GDLâ€™s initial purpose is to support access to high quality
              early-grade reading resources. Other types of learning resources
              may be included at a later stage.

            <P>
              The GDL-platform is a collaborative endeavour which will require
              involvement from a broad spectrum of stakeholders in order to be
              truly successful and widely used. It is being built based on
              existing quality learning resources provided from a variety of
              initiatives.
            </P>
            <P>
              The idea to develop a Global Digital Library for reading resources
              came from All Children Reading: a Grand Challenge for Development
              (ACR) in 2014. The GDL-platform is being developed and will
              initially be operated by the Norwegian Digital Learning Arena
              (NDLA). The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)
              has the overall project management responsibility.
