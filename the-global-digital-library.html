        <h1>The Global Digital Library</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Global Reading Repository (GRR) feasibility study, which was co-financed by USAID and Norad and published on 11.06.2016, brought important recommendations about how the international donor community could contribute to making more mother tongue reading materials available through the creation or further development of a digital repository. There is furthermore a close connection between this feasibility study and the broader feasibility study leading up to the development of a Global Book Alliance, with USAID and Norad being deeply involved together with several other partners.</p>

        <h2>Inclusion of marginalized groups</h2>
        <p>Although there have been major strides in education enrollment over the past 15 years, about 250 million children of primary school age are still unable to recognize basic letters and numbers. Worryingly, 130 million of these children attend 4years or more of school and still leave without basic foundational skills.Evidence supports the role of books in improving learning and reading acquisition, yet many children lack access to both reading books and textbooks.</p>

        <p>Over the past few decades, donors, including bilateral organizations and private foundations, have provided millions of dollars in funding and programmatic support to improve the provision and usage of books.The Global Digital Library is intended to be a means of distributing mother tongue (MT) learning resources worldwide to support children’s literacy learning in their local languages.</p>

        <p>GDL is envisioned to ensure that a reliable supply of high-quality mother(MT) tongue books and other learning resources become available to all. This reliable supply, in concert with outreach, advocacy, and education, could increase the use of MT books in schools and communities and improve literacy outcomes worldwide. GDL will be a web-based platform to facilitate the identification of and access tohigh-quality, early grade reading educational materials in MT languages. The educational material will be accessible in a print ready format as well as other relevant formats for web and mobile platforms.</p>

        <h2>Open licenses</h2>
        <p>The GDL platform will hold digital copies of Creative Commons or otherwise openly licensed, publicly accessible materials in print-ready formats. The primary licenses for GDL will be CC BY and CC BY-SA, these licenses drive innovation and creativity – including commercial reuse. They also support the overall goal of sharing, translation and re-contextualization of early grade reading educational materials, open textbooks and open educational resources.</p>

        <h2>Target audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience for GDL will be Ministries of Education, international and nationalNGOs, Norad and USAID missions, donors, implementing partners, local publishers, and other stakeholders, including schools, in developing countries.The platform will be open for all users, including end users with access to mobile devices and internet.GDL’s primary purpose is to support access to early-grade reading materials in children’s mother tongues, and can be expanded to other types of learning resources at a later stage.</p>

        <h2>Continuous quality assurance</h2>
        <p>The project will be subject to continuous quality assurance and «guiding» of content providers, technology developers, and other contributors to the project. In establishing the GDL repository, the project will extract a number of MT books from partner DLs prior to the launch of the GDL. This will require a dedicated review, ensuring that metadata are accurate and that GDL quality assurance support is provided.</p>
